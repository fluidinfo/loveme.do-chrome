==============================
The Fluidinfo chrome extension
==============================

The Fluidinfo extension helps you work with information while browsing the web. You can easily:

* Add info to anything
* See info you and your friends have added to URLs
* Jump to http://fluidinfo.com to look at anything

These are described below.

ADD INFO
--------

Click the extension icon to add info to the current URL.

You'll see a number of ways to add info. These include adding keywords, comments, ratings, marking pages to read later, and adding arbitrary info using a description and (an optional) value.

You can also add your current URL to anything else in Fluidinfo. Enter a description (e.g., image) and the thing in Fluidinfo you want to add to (e.g., @joe).  When anyone looks at the @joe object in Fluidinfo, they'll see the page you added to it.  This is easy visual tagging of anything. You can create attractive collections of info about anything at all.

You must be logged in to add info. Click the Login tab on the left of the Options page for details. Right click the Fluidinfo extension to see the Options page.

SEE INFO
--------

When you navigate to a page you've added to, popups will show you any info you or anyone you follow has added to it. To follow people, go to http://fluidinfo.com and log in, enter an @username to look at and click Go, then click Follow.

The extension icon will also display a count of the number of pieces of info you've added to the page.

Finally, if you select some text (a name, an email, a word, etc) and you or the people you follow have put info for that into Fluidinfo, popups will show it to you.

JUMP
----

There are many ways to quickly jump to fluidinfo.com to look at anything:

* Right-click the page background to jump to the current URL.
* Hover over any link and right-click to jump to the URL of the link or the text in the link.
* Hover over any image and right-click to jump to the URL of the image.
* Select any text on a web page, and right-click to jump to it.
* In the Chrome location bar, type "fi" and a Space. Then type anything you like, and hit Enter to jump to the Fluidinfo page for that thing.

FEEDBACK
--------

We'd love to hear what you think and to improve the extension based on your suggestions.  You can mail us at info@fluidinfo.com or come hang out with us in the #fluidinfo channel on irc.freenode.net.

Happy tagging!
