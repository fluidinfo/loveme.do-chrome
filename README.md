==============================
The Loveme.do chrome extension
==============================

The loveme.do extension lets you comment on any URL or text you select, and see the comments made by others. Comments include mentions that people make about URLs on other services, including Disqus, Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter.

Adding a comment
----------------

You must be logged in to add comments, and for that you'll need a Twitter account. Click the extension icon and then the login button.

Once logged in, you can click the extension icon to add info to the URL you are currently viewing or to any text you have selected. Comments that have already been made on that thing will be show. It's very useful to put hashtags into comments, as these can be viewed in their own right on loveme.do and we collect information about hastags as well as URLs from the above services.

Note: at the moment you'll need to reload pages you already have open when you install the extension (if you want to use the extension on those pages).  We'll fix that soon.

Seeing things in the sidebar or on loveme.do
--------------------------------------------

There are several ways to view URLs or text in the sidebar or to quickly jump to http://loveme.do to look at anything:

* Right-click the page background to jump to the current URL.
* Hover over a link and right-click to jump to the URL of the link or the text in the link.
* Hover over an image and right-click to jump to the URL of the image.
* Select any text and right-click to jump to it.
* In the Chrome location bar, type "lmd" (an easy abbreviation of loveme.do) and a Space or TAB. Then type anything you like, and hit Enter to jump to the loveme.do page for that thing.
