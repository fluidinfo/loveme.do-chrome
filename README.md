Installation and use
====================

For now you'll need to install the this as an unpacked extension in
Chrome. Visit `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode, and click
`Load unpacked extension`. Then navigate to the directory of this extension
and Chrome will do the rest.

When you have text selected in Chrome, or when you're over a link or an
image, the right-click context menu will give you the option of jumping to
the relevant thing (URL, selected text) in Fluidinfo.
