==============================
The Fluidinfo chrome extension
==============================

Use
---

The Fluidinfo extension makes it trivial to jump to Fluidinfo to examine
and tag anything you're looking at on the web.

When you have text selected in Chrome, or when you're over a link or an
image, the right-click context menu will give you the option of jumping to
that thing (URL, text of URL link, selected text) in Fluidinfo. You can
also click the blue Fluidinfo icon in the location bar to jump to the
object for the URL of the current page, or just right click on the
background of the page to do the same.

When over a linked image, the context menu will let you jump to either the
URL of the image or the URL of the link in Fluidinfo.

Install from the Chrome store
-----------------------------

You can install the extension most easily by visiting
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eilipheemcfeoafinogpabomclpejioj
and clicking 'Add to Chrome'.

Installing from source as an unpacked Chrome extension
------------------------------------------------------

Visit `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode, and click `Load
unpacked extension`. Then navigate to the directory of this extension and
Chrome will do the rest.
