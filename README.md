==============================
The Fluidinfo chrome extension
==============================

The Fluidinfo extension allows you to do two things:

1. Tag URLs in Fluidinfo while browsing.
2. Jump to Fluidinfo to examine and tag anything you're looking at on the web.

Tagging URLs
------------

To tag URLs, you will first need to log in. Right-click the Fluidinfo icon
and enter your Fluidinfo username and password.  Then, when browsing,
(left) click the Fluidinfo icon at any time to tag the current URL.

You'll see a number of ways you can tag. These include adding a tag with a
value, adding tags with no values (like keywords or old-fashioned tags),
adding ratings, read-later, comments, like tags, etc.

Most interesting and thought-provoking though is to use the current URL as
the value of a tag. You can enter the name of a tag (e.g., 'image') and the
thing in Fluidinfo you want to tag (e.g., @joe) and the @joe object in
Fluidinfo will be tagged with the URL as the value of the tag named
'image'.  Then when anyone looks at the Fluidinfo page for @joe, they'll
see your tag as an embedded web page or image (of the URL you were looking
at).  This is easy visual tagging of anything. It lets you create
attractive mini web sites about anything at all just with the push of a few
buttons and a copy/paste of some URLs. Want to pass a URL to a friend, tag
their @name object with it as a tag value. It might sound complicated, but
it's very simple when you see it in action. Don't be shy, give it a try!

Jumping to pages in Fluidnfo
----------------------------

When you have text selected, or when you're over a link or an image, the
right-click context menu will give you the option of jumping to that thing
(URL, text of URL link, or selected text) in Fluidinfo. You can also
right-click the background of the page to to jump to the Fluidinfo page for
your current URL. When over a linked image, the context menu will let you
jump to either the URL of the image or the URL of the link in Fluidinfo.

Install from the Chrome store
-----------------------------

You can install the extension most easily by visiting
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eilipheemcfeoafinogpabomclpejioj
and clicking 'Add to Chrome'.

Installing from source as an unpacked Chrome extension
------------------------------------------------------

Visit `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode, and click `Load
unpacked extension`. Then navigate to the directory of this extension and
Chrome will do the rest.  Make sure you disable any other version of the
extension you have running so you don't get two Fluidinfo icons in your
browser.

Feedback
--------

We'd love to hear your feedback and to work to improve the extension based
on suggestions.  You can mail us at info@fluidinfo.com or come hang out on
the #fluidinfo IRC channel with us on irc.freenode.net.

Happy tagging!
